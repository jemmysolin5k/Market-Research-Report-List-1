<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Duck Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The duck vaccines market primarily consists of two types: live vaccines and killed vaccines. Live vaccines use weakened forms of pathogens to stimulate immunity, often providing a strong and long-lasting response. They are typically administered to young ducks for robust health protection. Killed vaccines, on the other hand, contain inactivated pathogens and are safer with fewer side effects, often used in older birds or in regions with strict regulations. Both types play crucial roles in controlling diseases in duck populations.</p></p>
